### About this course:

 We are going to cover the following topics,
1. Introduction to Stan: a probabilistic programming language
2. Meta-analysis and measurement models
3. Model evaluation and model selection
4. Multinomial processing trees and mixture models
5. Accumulator models and Drift-diffusion models

The book An Introduction to Bayesian Data Analysis for Cognitive Science (chapter 10 onwards) by Bruno Nicenboim, Daniel Schad, and Shravan Vasishth.

Lecture style: The lectures will consist of an introduction to the topic and some do-in-class exercises. It is important in an advanced Bayesian course to get quick feedback and learn it by doing. You should bring your laptops (with working R and Stan setup).
